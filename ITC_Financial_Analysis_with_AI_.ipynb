They have set short to medium targets for key priority areas like climate change, water stewardship, plastic waste and circular economy, sustainable agriculture, biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihoods. ITC's Businesses have targets for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like specific energy consumption, specific greenhouse gas emissions, specific water intake and specific waste generation. All ITC Units have established management systems which entail regular monitoring of environmental KPIs, development of an environmental management plan, and reviewing progress on a regular basis to ensure that Businesses are on track with respect to the agreed roadmap.\n",
